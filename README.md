# [Favorite Furmaner Places Map](https://furmancenter.github.io/cool-places-map/)

### Add Your Own Cool Places!

You can now add new places directly from the map. Do do so you first need to sign-in with Google (to make changes to the back-end googlesheet). Once signed-in, simply click on the location where you'd like to add a new place, and fill out the information. 

### Add More Place Types!

1. Add the option the the googlesheet [`dataValidation` sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hbCidPNlF2mbI-l4xHH6nt8WJyHXQqWpZ_EAXRylC-4/edit#gid=218059596)

2. Either [file an issue](https://github.com/FurmanCenter/cool-places-map/issues) requesting a new color for the place type, or make a [pull request](https://github.com/FurmanCenter/cool-places-map/wiki/Contributing-code) to add the color yourself! (You can add the color to the javascript file [here](https://github.com/FurmanCenter/cool-places-map/blob/master/docs/js/scripts.js#L15))
